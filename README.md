## Introduction

Analyzing and interpreting sequencing data is a fundamental task in bioinformatics, especially when studying adaptive sampling MinION sequencing data. To address this challenge, we have developed a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline consisting of three modules: "analyze," "plot," and "filter_ONT." Our pipeline aims to provide researchers with a streamlined and efficient workflow for processing and analyzing sequencing data, enabling them to gain valuable insights into their datasets.

The "analyze" module serves as the core component of our pipeline. It takes an input fastq file, a reference fastq file, and an optional sequencing summary file from ONT sequencers. Leveraging tools such as fastp, minimap2, pysam, and mash, this module performs a series of essential tasks. It filters the input fastq file, maps it to the reference fastq file, and generates sequence manifest files and summary sequence manifest files, which contain various sequencing statistics.

The "plot" module complements the analysis performed by the "analyze" module. It takes as input both a test and control directory containing manifest and manifest summary files generated by the "analyze" module. With these files, the "plot" module generates visualizations that aid in the interpretation and visualization of the sequencing data.

To further enhance the versatility of our pipeline, we have developed the "filter_ONT" module. This module enables users to filter reads from a fastq file based on a sequencing summary file. Researchers can customize their filtering criteria by specifying parameters such as channel, duration, start time, q score, and length.

By providing a comprehensive suite of modules, our bioinformatics pipeline offers a powerful tool for researchers working with adaptive sampling MinION sequencing data. Whether you are exploring metagenomics sample composition, investigating adaptive sampling for your project, or conducting a comparative analysis of different methods in your lab, our pipeline can streamline your analyses and provide valuable insights into your genomic datasets.

Quick start
=====
To quickly get started with the `analyze` module, follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary input files and reference database prepared:
   - **Input Fastq files:** Provide the path to the Fastq files you want to process using the `--input_fastq` option.
   - **Reference database:** Specify the path to the reference database using the `--input_reference` option.

2. Choose an output directory for the results:
   - Specify the output directory using the `--output` option. This is a required parameter.

3. Run the command with the basic required options:

        sequenoscope analyze --input_fastq <file.fq> --input_reference <ref.fasta> -o <output_directory> -seq_type <sr>

This command will initiate the analysis process using default settings. The Fastq files will be processed, and the results will be saved in the specified output directory.

Please note that this is a simplified quick start guide, and additional options are available for advanced usage. For more detailed information on available options, you can run `sequenoscope analyze -h` or `sequenoscope analyze --help`.

Remember to replace `<file.fq>` with the actual path to your Fastq file, `<ref.fasta>` with the path to your reference database, `<output_directory>` with the desired location for the output files and `<sr>` with your sequencing type (SE for single-end and PE for paired-end).

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the full documentation or consult the available resources for troubleshooting.

To quickly get started with the `filter_ONT` module, follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary input files prepared:
   - **Input Fastq files:** Provide the path to the adaptive sequencing Fastq files you want to process using the `--input_fastq` option.
   - **ONT sequencing summary file:** Specify the path to the ONT sequencing summary file using the `--input_summary` option.

2. Choose an output file and directory for the filtered reads:
   - Specify the output file path and directory using the `--output` option. This is a required parameter.

3. Set the desired filtering criteria:
   - You can apply various filters to the reads based on the following options:
     - Classification: Use the `-cls` or `--classification` option to designate the adaptive-sampling sequencing decision classification. Valid options are `'unblocked'`, `'stop_receiving'`, or `'no_decision'`.
     - Channel/Pore number: Set the minimum and maximum channel/pore number for filtering using the `-min_ch` and `-max_ch` options.
     - Duration: Define the minimum and maximum duration of the sequencing run in seconds using the `-min_dur` and `-max_dur` options.
     - Start time: Specify the minimum and maximum start time of the sequencing run in seconds using the `-min_start` and `-max_start` options.
     - Q score: Determine the minimum and maximum q score for filtering using the `-min_q` and `-max_q` options.
     - Read length: Set the minimum and maximum read length for filtering using the `-min_len` and `-max_len` options.

4. Run the command with the basic required options:

        sequenoscope filter_ONT --input_fastq <file.fq> --input_summary <seq_summary.txt> -o <output.fastq>

This command will initiate the filtering process based on the specified criteria and save the filtered reads to the output file.

Please note that this is a simplified quick start guide, and additional options are available for advanced usage. For more detailed information on available options, you can run `sequenoscope filter_ONT -h` or `sequenoscope filter_ONT --help`.

Remember to replace `<file.fq>` with the actual path to your adaptive sequencing Fastq file, `<seq_summary.txt>` with the path to your ONT sequencing summary file, and `<output.fastq>` with the desired path and filename for the filtered reads.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the full documentation or consult the available resources for troubleshooting.

- **Control Directory:** Specify the path to the control directory that contains the seq manifest files from the analyze module. `-C` or `--control_dir` `<control_dir_path>`
- **Output Directory:** Choose an output directory for the plots. `-o` or `--output_dir` `<out_path>`

2. **Plotting Options:** Customize your plots with various options:
- **Output Prefix:** You can add a prefix before plot names with the `--output_prefix` option. `-op` or `--output_prefix` `<OUTPUT_PREFIX>`. *Default is 'sample'*.
- **Comparison Metric:** Select a parameter for the box plot and single ratio bar chart using the `--comparison_metric` option. *Default parameter is taxon_%_covered_bases*.

- **Time Bin Unit:** Designate a time bin used for decision bar charts. `-bin` or `--time_bin_unit` `{seconds,minutes,5m,15m,hours}`. *Default bin is minutes*

3. **Run the Command:** With the basic required options:

        sequenoscope plot --test_dir <test_dir_path> --control_dir <control_dir_path> --output_dir <out_path>

Use the `--force flag` if you wish to force an overwrite of an existing results directory.

Please note that this is a simplified quick start guide, and additional options are available for advanced usage. For more detailed information on available options, you can run `sequenoscope plot -h` or `sequenoscope plot --help`.

Remember to replace `<test_dir_path>`, `<control_dir_path>`, and `<out_path>` with the actual paths for your directories.
