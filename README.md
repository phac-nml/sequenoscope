## Introduction

Analyzing and interpreting sequencing data is a fundamental task in bioinformatics, and with the advent of ONT adaptive-sampling sequencing, specialized tools are needed to visualize and assess sequencing runs. The unique data output and complex dynamics of adaptive sampling present challenges in effectively visualizing and assessing these sequencing runs, necessitating tailored analytical approaches. To address these challenges, we have developed a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline consisting of three modules: 'analyze,' 'plot,' and 'filter_ONT.' Our pipeline aims to provide researchers with a streamlined and efficient workflow for processing and analyzing sequencing data, enabling them to gain valuable insights into their datasets.

The [analyze](#analyze-module) module serves as the core component of our pipeline. It takes an input FASTQ file, a reference FASTA file, and an optional sequencing summary file from ONT sequencers. Leveraging tools such as `fastp`, `minimap2`, `pysam`, and `mash`, this module performs a series of essential tasks. It filters the input FASTQ file, maps it to the reference FASTA file, and generates a __sequence manifest__ file and __summary sequence manifest__ file, which contain various sequencing statistics.

The [plot](#plot-module) module complements the analysis performed by the "analyze" module. It takes as input both a test and control directory containing __manifest__ and __manifest summary__ files generated by the "analyze" module. With these files, the [plot](#plot-module) module generates visualizations that aid in the interpretation and visualization of the sequencing data.

To further enhance the versatility of our pipeline, we have developed the [filter_ONT](#filter_ONT-module) module. This module enables users to filter reads from a FASTQ file based on a sequencing summary file. Researchers can customize their filtering criteria by specifying parameters such as channel, duration, start time, q score, and length.

To demonstrate the practical application of our pipeline, consider a scenario where a researcher conducts adaptive sampling using an ONT sequencer. In this example, the researcher divides the sequencer pores into two sets: one half for adaptive sampling enrichment and the other half for regular sequencing as a control. Utilizing our [filter_ONT](#filter_ONT-module) module, the researcher can create two distinct sets of FASTQ files, each representing the minimum and maximum channels of the sequencing data. These files are then processed separately through our [analyze](#analyze-module) module, generating two datasets â€“ one for the test (adaptive sampling) and one for the control (regular sequencing). Finally, by employing the [plot](#plot-module) module, the researcher can visually assess the effectiveness of the adaptive sampling enrichment in their experiment. This practical illustration highlights how our pipeline facilitates comprehensive data processing and analysis, enhancing the researcher's ability to draw meaningful conclusions from their ONT sequencing data.

By providing a comprehensive suite of modules, our bioinformatics pipeline offers a powerful tool for researchers working with adaptive sampling MinION sequencing data. Whether you are exploring metagenomics sample composition, investigating adaptive sampling for your project, or conducting a comparative analysis of different methods in your lab, our pipeline can streamline your analyses and provide valuable insights into your genomic datasets.

## Quick start

## analyze module

To quickly get started with the `analyze` module, follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure that you have the necessary input files and reference database prepared:
   - **Input FASTQ files:** Provide the path to the FASTQ files you want to process using the `--input_FASTQ` option.
   - **Reference database:** Specify the path to the reference database using the `--input_reference` option.

2. Choose an output directory for the results:
   - Specify the output directory using the `--output` option. This is a required parameter.

3. Run the command with the basic required options:

        sequenoscope analyze --input_FASTQ <file.fq> --input_reference <ref.FASTA> -o <output_directory> -seq_type <sr>

This command will initiate the analysis process using default settings. The FASTQ files will be processed, and the results will be saved in the specified output directory.

Please note that this is a simplified quick start guide, and additional options are available for advanced usage. For more detailed information on available options, you can run `sequenoscope analyze -h` or `sequenoscope analyze --help`.

Remember to replace `<file.fq>` with the actual path to your FASTQ file, `<ref.FASTA>` with the path to your reference database, `<output_directory>` with the desired location for the output files and `<sr>` with your sequencing type (SE for single-end and PE for paired-end).
